# MapBashkortostanCulture-MobileApp
This project, a mobile application was developed, the main task was the use of GIS technologies, namely: working with an area map, creating beacons on an arbitrary set of locations, establishing integration with existing platforms for tracking the position of a smartphone and helping the user navigate the area. From this task grew the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a resource with information about the main cultural centers of the capital of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Ufa. In this application you can find background information about the theaters and museums of the city, determine your location in the city and get directions to the desired cultural center.
